# TSV Accounting App

This application streamlines the process of completing the Daily Accounting spreadsheet, targeting routine tasks at my previous job.

Users can upload a Fuesbox CSV file containing credit card transactions and a Siriusware CSV file with both credit card data and item descriptions. The application analyzes these files to identify discrepancies in transaction amounts. Additionally, it cross-references user-provided values with data from the Siriusware CSV file. Finally, the application generates a new .xlsx file incorporating both the user inputs and CSV data, and then saves this file for future use.
