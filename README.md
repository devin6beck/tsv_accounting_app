# tsv_accounting_app

A program that automates the boring parts of completing the Daily accounting spreadsheet at my old job.

The user uploads a Fuesbox CSV file that has credit card data and a Siriusware CSV file that has credit card data and descriptions of items sold. The application comapres the two CSV files and lets the user know the difference in the values. The application also compares values given by the user against the Siriusware CSV file. Finnaly the application writes a new .xlsx file using user input and data from the CSV files and saves the new .xlsx file for the user. 

To manually test the application there are example CSV files in the CSV repository.
